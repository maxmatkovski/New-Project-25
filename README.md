# APT Threat Intelligence Analyzer

## Mission
Nation-state cyber threats operate at unprecedented levels of sophistication, with Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) - elite hacking groups backed by governments - conducting long-term espionage and sabotage campaigns against critical infrastructure like power grids, military systems, and government networks. These aren't typical hackers looking for quick money; they're sophisticated operations that hide in systems for months or years, stealing secrets and preparing for potential cyberwarfare.

Security analysts are overwhelmed by the volume of threat intelligence reports, spending hours manually extracting indicators of compromise (IOCs) - the digital fingerprints attackers leave behind like malicious IP addresses or malware signatures - mapping attacker tactics (how they break in, move around, and steal data), and attempting to attribute attacks to specific threat actors (figuring out if it was Russia, China, North Korea, etc.).

This project aims to accelerate threat intelligence analysis through AI automation - ingesting raw threat reports and instantly extracting actionable intelligence, mapping attack techniques to the MITRE ATT&CK framework (a comprehensive database of hacker tactics used by security professionals worldwide), and attributing campaigns to known APT groups with confidence scoring. By reducing analysis time from hours to seconds, security teams can respond faster to emerging threats and make strategic decisions about national defense priorities.

## 🔍 Overview

The APT Threat Intelligence Analyzer is an AI-powered platform that automatically processes cybersecurity threat reports and transforms them into actionable intelligence. 

**What it does:**
- **Ingests** threat intelligence from various sources (PDFs, articles, security reports)
- **Extracts** key information using Natural Language Processing (NLP) - teaching computers to understand human language
- **Analyzes** attack patterns and matches them against known nation-state hacking groups
- **Visualizes** the threat landscape through interactive dashboards showing who's attacking, how they're doing it, and what they're targeting
- **Predicts** potential future targets based on historical attack patterns

Instead of security analysts spending 4-6 hours manually reading through a report and connecting the dots, this system does it in seconds - identifying the threat actor, their methods, and providing strategic recommendations for defense. Think of it as an AI assistant that reads thousands of pages of hacker intelligence and instantly tells you "this looks like Russian APT28, they're targeting energy sectors, and here's what they'll likely do next."


## 🏗️ Architecture

The system is built in four main layers that work together to transform raw threat reports into actionable intelligence:
